# Bullet Journal

This project is aimed at building a bullet journal software. We have eight members in our [team](admin/team.md). 

Our bullet journal will be capable of doing the following:
- be a task list
- planner
- journal

Within these parts, certain features that it will include are:
- an index
- rapid logging
- different symbols which have different meanings
- will be able to contain various content (images, videos, text, etc...)
- collections of items (time based or custom)
- Migration
