# BananaNotes

BananaNotes is a bullet journaling application that is designed to rapidly log and organize a user's information. The goal of this application is to function as a planner, journal, and task list.

## Usage
Visit [BananaNotes](https://github.com/Max-Edelson/cse110-sp21-group16/BananaNotes.html) to get started.

### **Rapid Logging Page**
When you first open the app, you will be confronted with our rapid logging page. This is where you will be able to quickly and easily log information about the day, may it be a note, task, or event, and then you can migrate it to another log. The migration can take the form of a single item (note, task, or event) or it can be an entire entry. If the migration is a single item, it can be sent to any of the other logs (monthly log, daily log, future log, or custom log). If the migration is an entire entry, then it only has the option to go to a custom log that accepts entries.

### **Monthly Log**
The monthly log contains all the notes, tasks, and events for each day in a given month. In the calender view, clicking on a day will open up the daily log for that day. Clicking on an item in a day will open up a window with information for that day. In the list view, all notes, tasks, and events are vertically listed in chronological order.

### **Daily Log**
The daily log contains all the information for a given day and all information from the rapid log is sent to the daily log if it was inserted in the item-view page. Information is added to the log through migration from the rapid log.

### **Future Log**
The future log contains a limited amout of notes, tasks, and events (up to eight) for each month up to six months from the current month. Clicking on an item in a list will open up information about the item. Information is added to the log through migration from the rapid log.

### **Custom Log**
The custom log is where the user can make lists that are not necessarily time based. There are two different types of custom logs, one is where the items are listed out one after the other and the other type is where entries are listed out one after the other. An example of a list custom log is where a user simply lists the
