How and when to use comments:
- Describe code functions (headers)
- Describe code blocks
- logic loops
- Describe const variables

Tabs for indentation (Default)

Appropriate use of white space:
- One line between code blocks
- One line between functions
- NO white space between code and header

Proper naming of variables and functions:
- camel case for everything
- magic numbers or strings (unchanging variables) = ALL CAPS 

Code grouping an organization:
- Functions that are related should be next to eachother
- 

Patterns to be used:
- Keep all files together (for now)
- Cruly bracket "{" at the end of the line
- Space between if/for and ()
- else statement in new line
- space between // and what ever you are commenting

Patterns to be avoided:
- not descriptive variable names
- really long lines longer than 80 chars (break it up)
