# Onboarding Information

## Meeting Notes Instructions
Whenever meeting to discuss project-related issues, one should make meeting notes that notes when the meeting took place, who was present, who was absent (and should have been there), and agenda, and all relevant discussion notes.
These meeting notes belong in the ```main``` branch in ~/admin/meeting/ and should have the form ```MM-DD-YYYY_XXXX_XXXX.md```.
If a video is recorded of a meeting the video file may be added to ~/admin/videos/, but a YouTube link must be added to [video_links.md](https://github.com/Max-Edelson/cse110-sp21-group16/blob/main/admin/videos/video_links.md).

## Pull Requests and Issues
Pull requests and issues should be assigned to any and all involved parties, given concise titles, and be given good descriptions. Both the titles and the descriptions should be in present tense and start with a capital letter. If they are on a general theme, then the title should follow: ```THEME: ......```
Example: ```BUG FIX: Fixing Item objects not saving.``` When merging to the ```main``` branch, two approvals are needed to merge as a form of code quality control.

## Commits
Commits should be in present tense and start with a capital letter.

## Branches
There should never be any redundant branches and branches created with the sole purpose of merging into the main branch should be swiftly deleted after the pull request has been merged. As soon as a branch is no longer relevant, it should be merged (if necessary) and then deleted from the remote repository.
Branche names should be all lowercase and words should be seperated with hyphens (-).
