## We will have to design custom logs for user to use. 

Custom log is one important part of a journal. We had a discusssion about the design of custom logs as we did not know what custom logs would look like. 

## Decision Drivers 

* Different users have different ways to use custom logs.
* Users might use custom logs as a list
* Users might just want to use custom logs to take notes.

## Considered Options
* Include notes and list in custom logs as two choice so that users can decide by themselves.
* Only choose to implement list or implement notes.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Include notes and list in custom logs as two choice so that users can decide by themselves.", because users need is the priority of the application. We wish every user can be satisfied and get to choose which kind of custom log they want to use.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
