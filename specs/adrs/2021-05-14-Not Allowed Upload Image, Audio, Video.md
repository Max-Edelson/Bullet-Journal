* Status: accepted
* Deciders: The whole team member
* Date: 2021-05-14

## We decided to use local storage as the data storage method. With reserach, the maximum storage is 5MB. We are afraid that users cannot store what they want to store.

We had a discussion about use local storage for our data storage. With only 5MB, we wish users can still store their most important data.

## Decision Drivers 

* Video takes up too much space
* Audio takes up too much space
* Images take up to much space.

## Considered Options
* Let users store whatever they want, include video, audio, images
* Only let users store text

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Only let users store text", because most people used to record to take notes are the text. This is the basic functionality of our log. We do not want other like image, video and audio take up too much space. In that way, texts will lose their their functionality. 
### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We don't have to include designs and implementation for image, audio and video
* We are confident that the storage is enough for a short time

* They might want to store image, audio, video as well.
