# Use 'SPA' in our project (Changed in 06/05/2021, Finallly decided use links. Reasons at the end of the document)
* Status: accepted
* Deciders: The whole team member
* Date: 2021-05-21

## We almost have done the html part of each page, we are thinking about how to route each page.
Normally we let users navigate page by creatting different links. During Lab 7, we were introduced the concept of 'Single Page Application.' We found it very useful and interesting so we considered to combine it with our project.

## Decision Drivers 

* We have knowledge aboout the 'SPA'
* We do have different pages that we need to navigate between.
* We found that 'SPA' is very useful.

## Considered Options
* Use'SPA' to navigate pages
* Creating links betweeen different page and navigate.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use'SPA' to navigate pages", because it is more efficient and quicker for users to load the different pages. If the users have bad netwrok, they have higher chance to load pages.
### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Page that was loaded will be quicker
* Coders can code faster because they have already learned and practice the knowledge.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
* We just studied the concept so there might be many other challenges related that we might encounter.


## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### [option 1]

Use'SPA' to navigate pages.<!-- optional -->

* Good, because users can load relatively faster even if they have a bad network.
* Good, because we just practiced using it.

### [option 2]

Creating links betweeen different page and navigate.<!-- optional -->

* Good, because we know how to implement it.
* Bad, users might find loading different pages slow if they have bad network connection.

## Final Decision(06-05-2021)
Although I thought 'SPA' was a good choice to connect all the files into one application, we decided to use links between different page and navigate. During the process of our project, each person in our front-end group is doing one log. There are some duplicate class names. Some people designed their logs with navigation bar and some people don't, so it is very difficult to do 'SPA' between different logs. So we finally decided to use links to navigate.
