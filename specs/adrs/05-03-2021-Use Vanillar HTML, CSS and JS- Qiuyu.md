# Using only vanillar html, css and javascript throughout the whole project process

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: The whole team member
* Date: 2021-05-10

## We are on the coding phase so we need to decide what to use so that everyone can keep up with each other

We have finished the design process. With the design we had, we decided to start coding as soon as possible. There are many frameworks and libraries for us to choose. With these libraries and framworks, we don't know they will help us or be a problem for us. Not all of us have experience of using different frameworks and libraries. 

## Decision Drivers 

* TAs and Professors will only provide help for vanilla html, css an javascript
* We need time to study different framework and libraries
* However, frameworks and libraries might help us to build our website 

## Considered Options
* Use vanilla html, css and javascript
* Use Bootstrap and React
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: " Use vanilla html, css and javascript", because most people do not have the experiences of using Bootstrap and React before. We probably need tons of time to study these instead of start coding. Also we will get more help from TAs and Professor Powell.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We have started coding.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We might need to write more code to implement a feature
