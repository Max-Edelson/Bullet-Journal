# Using the local storage to save all our data

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: The whole team member
* Date: 2021-05-10

## We start to implement features with code. We need to think of a way to save all the user data.

We have finished the design process. With the design we had, we decided to start coding as soon as possible. With html, css and javascript, we still have a think of a way to save all our data to run our application.

## Decision Drivers 

* Not all of us understand sessions and cookies
* Not all of us know MySQL and Mongodb
* Local Storage is more hand-on to us.

## Considered Options
* Local Storage
* MySQL and Mongodb

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Local Storage", because most people do not have the experiences of using MySQL and Mongodb before. If we want to choose MySQL and Mongodb, we need to study from the very beginning. We don't have time for that.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Easier for us to start code
* Has enought storage limit
* Spend less time to learn and understand

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
* Have to collect documents to help us use it.


## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### [option 1]

Local Storage<!-- optional -->

* Good, because local storage has no expiration date. Data stored will not lose even after browser close.
* Good, because it is very easy to set, retrive, delete and get.
* Good, because it is easier to implement.

### [option 2]

MySQL and Mongodb<!-- optional -->

* Good, because standards are set and clear with these two.
* Good, because most people use them.
* Good, because no code is needed.
* Bad, most people in the group don't know how to use.
