## Notes from discussion:
- Retrospective video: youtube link...
- We talked about the situations of madness, sadness and gladness we encounted in the course and our project in one retro. That includes, we feel that "Labs teach us what need kind of late" to be the madness, "Keep writing code I am not sure we are going to use" "Having to scrap three calendar codes because we didn't know what was allowed/not allowed in coding" to be the sadness, "Lack of time to work on the project on a daily basis", "Don't know how to do the back-end", "we will not have time to implement everything we wanted to originally",and "communication is a little lacking".
- We also talked about the "Liked", "learned","Lacked" and "Long for" based on what we felt about the project and course.That includes, "long for more instructions" because we don't have enough guidance, "Like the teamwork", "lack some cross-team communication", "no specific guidelines on what we could/couldn't use in projects", "Lack sticking to weekly goals to ensure progress is being made" and etc. 
- We also talked about "Communication between faculty and us", "Merting Effectiveness","Focus Time","Task Clarity"and "Team Collaboration". The result is, they scored 2.1, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.4 out of 5 respectively in average.
- The last one includes "Do you feel comfortable speaking up", "Do you feel heard", "Do you feel included", "Do you feel overwhelmed?" and "Do you feel like your job is important". The result is , they scored 4.4, 4.8, 4.8, 3.3, 4.5 out of 5 respectively in average.
