### Who is missing:

## Notes from discussion:
**First retro (what went well and what didn't):**
- Need to discuss more about merging of teams in Monday's meeting
- Slow progress, everyone's preoccupied with other class responsibilities :(
- Demos and pair programming worked out great 
- Labs give us information later than needed 
- Frontend and backend teams have done a lot respectively, but app as a whole is not fully functional 

**Second retro (sad, mad, glad):**
- Difficult to juggle time and commitments 
- Members need to address: communication, pull requests and issues, people not delivering on what they say 
- We need to show any form of response to messages in Slack 
- More interaction on issues and pull requests 
- Give heads up on progress to keep team members up to date, especially if you can't finish a task on time 
- Need knowledge of frontend implementation to add "backend" Javascript 
- Imposter syndrome, where we don't feel like we know as much as other teams 
- Vague grading rubric, we don't know what we should prioritize to get the best grade possible 
- Good team building!!!

**Third retro (work happiness):**
- Clarity = 2.1
- Impact = 3.5
- Meaning = 3.1
- Engagement = 3.6
- Autonomy = 4.5
- Mastery = 3.3
- Clarity and autonomy have the smallest ranges 

**Fourth retro (product goal):**
- Work allotment = 3.9
- Product is detailed enough = 3.9
- Goals are relevant = 4.4
- Goals are achievable = 3.1
- Clearly communicated = 3.4
- We find ourselves continuously changing the goals and minimizing the product for MVP

- Possibly do a hackathon-style code sprint before deadline
