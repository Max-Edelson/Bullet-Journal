3. Discuss the roles of the project and dispense them.
4. Finalize team logo and choose someone willing to either "make it" or find it.
5. Double check that each member has contributed a bio and GitHub link on team.md.
6. Choose someone to help type a summary of the project for the README.md. This person will also be responsable for continuously adding to this page throughout the project as stated under the Group Kickoff assignment: "You should also create a README.md file in the root (/) of your repository with a short description of the project. This will serve as the landing page for your project and should be updated as you add code, tests, documentation and other important artifacts."
7. Make a 2.5 minute (or less) video that introduces the team.

## To-Do for next meeting:
1. Make sure that the README.md file has been typed up.
2. Make sure that the team.md file is completely finished.
3. Make sure that every member has signed and uploaded their signatures onto the rules.md file as a PDF.
