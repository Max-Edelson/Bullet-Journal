What we did: 
- Went over the custom element demo in more detail
- Went over the local storage demo in more detail
- Added issues to the repo and completed those issues when completing pull request for demos

Decisions:
- Might want to combine the custom element demo and local storage demo to store custom elements on local storage
- Might want to start connecting backend code to front end code
- Need to figure out how log classes will connect to the front end

Goals: 
- Work combine the demos and understanding eachothers code
